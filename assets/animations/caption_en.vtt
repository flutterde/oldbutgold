00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.460
You spoke out loud and clear. And
I will say here boldly now on television.

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.410
No, I will not go 10,000
miles from here to help murder

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.210
and kill another poor people,
simply to continue the domination

4
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.120
of white slave masters over
the darker people of the earth.

5
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.660
I don't I don't know. I
won't participate. No, sir. I'm a minister.

6
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.740
A preacher from the stand rostrum.
I don't I'm not a marcher.

7
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:42.150
But I will say here that I have in my
press release that I've said it once and I will say

8
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.570
it again. The real enemies of my
people are right here, not in Vietnam.

9
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.210
And we who follow the most Honorable
Elijah Muhammad take no part in wars.

10
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.550
As the holy Koran teaches us, we take parts
in no wars on the side of infidels or

11
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.540
Christians or nonbelievers in
Islam. No wars unless.
